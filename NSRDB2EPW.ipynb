    "+ Gather your query location as a [WKT geometry](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/) (in WGS84 CRS, could be Point, Polygon, MultiPolygon, etc. but a minimum working example is a Point) and prepare it as a string\n",
    "+ Determine the dataset you would like to query, and the appropriate temporal resolutions and the years you neeed.\n",
    "+ Obtain an API key. You can [sign up for your API key](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/).\n",
    "+ Translate the geometry into NSRDB point_ids (automated by the pipeline, no need to worry)\n",
    "+ Get the weather data about the associated point_ids and parse them into DataFrames and write them as CSVs (automated by the pipeline, no need to worry)\n",
